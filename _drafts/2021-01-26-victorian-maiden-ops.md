<p>So one of my dream dresses is Victorian Maiden's Majestic Rose OP.</p>

<p>I'm really into grey's lately.. not sure why. I think it's an underrated color in lolita. I think Victorian Maiden is one of those brands I slept too hard on. When I first started lolita, they had prints like flamingos which just really turned me off from paying attention to them. </p>

<p>I think the black is equally as gorgeous. I don't think there's a lot of lolita dresses like this with such bold colors.</p>

<p>When Stripe Rose Ruffle Dress came out, I felt it was similar enough to jump on it. So here we are.</p>
