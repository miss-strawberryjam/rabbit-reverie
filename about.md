<li><b>name:</b> michelle</li>
<li><b>favorite subfashion:</b> classic lolita, but sometimes I dabble in sweet lolita</li>
<li><b>favoite brand:</b> Mary Magdalene with Victorian Maiden being second</li>
<li>I prefer more simple, daily looks. I like solid dresses with attention to details, but also enjoy florals</li>

p.s. I'm not anyone special and I feel like making this website implies that I think I am <i>important</i> (it's not true). In any case, I  hope you'll still enjoy a little slice of what I feel about lolita fashion.
