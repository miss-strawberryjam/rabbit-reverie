<p>I wore this coordinate to the zoo when California wasn't on complete lock down. It's been really rough, probably less so for me because I have a toddler so I don't have a lot of freedom anyways. I used to wear lolita every weekend. It didn't matter where I was going - I could be just going to do groceries. I just liked wearing it and I didn't care how people reacted. I remember reading somwhere that someone felt wearing lolita was like wearing armor. I'm not sure if that's the case for me, but it is definitely the 1-2 days a week that I feel like I am truly me. Every other day of the week, I wear practical (generally Jfashion still) clothes, but they feel like a substitute for the sake of time and fitting in. On these "practical" days, I'm always yearning until the day I can wear lolita again. I daydream about about the coordinate I will wear and perfect it until that day.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm particularly proud of this coordinate. It was from a time when I was feeling less passionate about lolita. I was having a hard time enjoying lolita while managing work and family life. Since then, I've been looking for alternative ways to enjoy lolita when I don't wear it often. This blog is helping a lot with that and <a href="http://www.rabbitreverie.com/2021/01/15/reevaluating-my-wardrobe.html">working on my wardrobe</a> has helped too.</p>
