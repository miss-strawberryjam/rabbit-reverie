<p>I hung out with my friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kayas.coords/">Michelle</a> over the weekend. I had a really good time at her house and she is very sweet!</p>
<p>We twinned Mary Magdalene's Mary Lou OP. I got this dress recently after seeing Michelle wear it.. I really like the pink color. Pastel colors are really appealing to me!</p>

<p>She also showed me her tiny irons and was able to bring my Petit Fours bow back to life!</p>
