<p>The last month or so of my life has all been about independence. I have a desire to be a stronger woman, to no longer depend on others.</p>

<p>I lived alone for a month. It was strange doing things on my own at first, but I came to enjoy the peace (and the daydreaming too!).</p>

<p>I am planning on going on a solo trip too! I was thinking of going to Montreal and Quebec City. I don't know much about it there, but in my mind, it seems like a perfect place for a classic lolita who likes old buildings and museums.</p>

<p>These small things may seem very trivial, I know.

	I wore this coordinate to the museum of Legion of Honor. I was most interested in seeing Monet's paintings.

<p>Some lolita adjacent things in my life..<br>
	I decided to frame this Mucha picture. And I pressed some daisies that I got from Mother's Day.

One last thing.. I got this dress Panier de Fleurs! In the purple color! I have already worn it a couple of times and it has officially become one of my favorite dresses.
