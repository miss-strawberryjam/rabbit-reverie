<p>Because it's a 3 day weekend, I miraculously had a little time to put together a coordinate. It's a really simple one, but I think this dress (Claudette by Mary Magdalene) is one of those dresses that thrives in the details and doesn't always need a lot of flair going on.

Too bad the lighting at my house is really terrible...
