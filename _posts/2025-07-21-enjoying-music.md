<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ZIpOznhS4f0?feature=shared">▶︎•၊၊||၊|။|||||။၊|။• Ozma - Domino Effect</a></p>
<p>I feel nostalgic about this song.. it was released in 2001. I was 13 then. I really miss alternative music from this era plus 90's.</p>
<p>I was listening to Third Eye Blind and Apple music began to shuffle random songs into the mix that sound similar and Motion City Soundtrack came up.</p>
<p>I live under a rock when it comes to a lot of music (-‿-") This band seems to use a Moog (a synthesizer) and I quite like it.</p>
<p>Their music really started to get me nostalgic for music from that time~ I started listening to Gin Blossoms too (they sang the song for Friends, but had plenty of other good songs too.)</p>
<p>So I ended up listening to Ozma - Domino Effect. The song is about missing an opportunity to confess to a girl they like.</p>
<p>Now I'm listening to The Rentals too! They use a Moog too. I don't know why I like synthesizers so much? :thinking: They just have a cute, cool retro sound~ It kinda makes me feel like my aesthetic has a song to it!</p>
<p>No, Barbie Girl is not my aesthetic irl just because I like pink :hmphhhhhhhh:</p>
<p>Now I'm back my to favorite band when I was a teenager - Weezer! I loved them cos of how nerdy they were, but also >< cos the lead singer wrote this song <a href="https://youtu.be/1mxEoA3G9Wg?feature=shared">Across the Sea</a>. It's about the lead singer receiving a letter from a fan in Japan and describing how cute the stationary was, wondering what her room looked like, etc. It made me think a lot about myself since I always liked such cute stuff! Yeah I was a gush-y teenager, haha.</p>
<p>I really like this song <a href="https://youtu.be/r2dosVRzLSM?feature=shared">Weezer - I Threw Out the Love of My Dreams</a>. This song isn't sang by the lead singer, but a guest female singer. I felt inspired enough that I even sang a karaoke of it back in the day, but it is sadly lost to time. I used to sing a lot! I'm not great at it though haha. I was in choir a bit, I think it might be fun to join something again.</p>

<p>Life was so simple back then.. now I'm a divorced single mother >< I have many things to be happy about, but I wish I had someone to spend life with ^^ Hoping it will come true soon~</p>

<p>thanks for reading my ramblings!</p>
