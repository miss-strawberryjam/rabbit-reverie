<p>I've been in a better mental space recently! So I've been able to craft a lot more yay ^^</p>
<p>That includes embroidery and sewing! Sometimes I spy on the local facebook buy nothing group and a lady was giving away a lot of fabric! There were a lot of cute florals ^^</p>

	<p>Here's how it looks after coordinating ^^ I'm wearing a bear cardigan for Metamorphose. The dress is off brand! And the bag is from Katie.</p>

	<p>I also wore it with a Mary Magdalene dress another day! I'm kind of enjoying doing sacrilege and turning classic lolita in sweet classic lolita :thinking:</p>
