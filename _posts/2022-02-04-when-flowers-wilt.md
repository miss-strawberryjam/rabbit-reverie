<p>Hello, like minded people that enjoy frills, it has been awhile since we last met.</p>
<p>I am upset at how little I can update my website, but I have also lost my passion for lolita (yet again).</p>
<p>A portion of it is related to how little time I have. I can count on my hands how many times I wore lolita in 2021. In a previous life, I used to yearn for the work week to end so that I could finally wear lolita over the weekend. Oh how times have changed..</p>

OP, Hair rosette (you cannot see it sadly): Mary Magdalene<br>
Jacket: Victorian Maiden<br>
Socks: Innocent World<br>

<p>And my terrible self deprecating personality wishes that I wore a nice blouse with this coordinate. But I do like that I have achieved some grandma goals by being able to camouflage with a couch!</p>

<p>I appreciate that I got some submissions to the guestbook, thank you! (It just took me a long 6 months to add it, sadly.)..</p>
