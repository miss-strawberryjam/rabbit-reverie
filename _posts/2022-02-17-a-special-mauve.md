I ordered this dress many months back. I have not been feeling passionate about lolita lately so when the dress arrived I let it sit in the box for awhile.. I had a look at it, but I did not try it on. I had imagined that it would not look good on me and that would be end of that.

But I finally decided on a whim to try it on and I am in love it. I wonder why I ever questioned my passion. Now I cannot wait to wear it until the next occasion.
