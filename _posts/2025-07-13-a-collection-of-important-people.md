<p>I guess this is gonna be one of those "be real" entries.. I've been reluctant to share what I have been going through, but...</p>
<p>I wanted to talk more about important people in my life... My last post included how much Scarlett meant to me. Yet somehow I never managed to express that to her. Only to all my other friends! </p>
<p>****Dream Sheep - I've known him forever. Like almost as long as I've been on the internet (ᵕ—ᴗ—) Uh I might have been really young then.. like 15 (ᵕ—ᴗ—) ... that was like early 2000's (you can do the math (×_×))</p>
<p>
He has been there for me during my most tough times. He's watched me grow. In my college days, I had crippling anxiety and he was there. I was scared to go out. Like even order food at a restaurant. Even to go to class. In more recent times, I was dealing with divorce and navigating a lot of complicated feelings. If you read my blog, you know I have been honest with my head space. He helped me get through a lot of these hard feelings. And being single has been difficult too. My low self esteem says no one could ever want me.
</p>
<p>I feel incredibly grateful.. we don't talk super often. But he considers me a good friend and that makes me so happy ;_; I feel the same <3 It's like no matter how long time passes, our connection remains strong.</p>
<p>He is one of first people that made me feel "seen". Like he understands my suffering without effort. and he tries to soothe it ;_; It used to be so hard for me to express my desires to others. I didn't want to cause issues and create a hassle. I just wanted to minimize myself so others were happy.. Unfortunately this has caused some friendships to end due to misunderstandings. But Dream Sheep sees me (╥﹏╥)</p>

<p>****Jelly Honey - JH is a new person in my life. Never in my life have I felt so "seen." We operate on different wavelengths, but he really is curious and asks the right questions to understand my and soothe my suffering ;_; 
</p>
<p>He sees my flaws and accepts them as they are and only wants to get closer to me. Spending time with him makes me so happy. Even just talking is fine. Being around him makes me think, "wow, is this how life is supposed to feel like?" I never have to minimize myself for him. He wants just the real me, even if it's flawed.</p>

<p>I hope it's not weird I talk so much about my suffering. I do know I have a lot to be grateful for. I try to remain positive on this blog.. but I really wanted these people to know how much I care <3</p>
<p>I realize now how much I lost my sense of self. I try to state my needs now, but I'm not experienced at it and this has also caused lost friendships >_<</p>
