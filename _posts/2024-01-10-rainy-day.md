<p>It is currently raining and I am waiting for the rain to pass. I should go buy milk after this. In the meantime, I am embroidering. Although I am not entirely sure I will wear this when I step out :sweat: Even though it's California, this is probably not a winter outfit.</p>

OP, Cardigan, Rosette: Mary Magdalene
</p>

<p>I am wearing one of my favorite dresses Claudette by Mary Magdalene! It reminds me of my calm place which is a wild flower meadow with a running stream near by, trees, and I'm under the shade on top of a blanket having a picnic. When I think of my calm place, I would be wearing this dress.</p>
