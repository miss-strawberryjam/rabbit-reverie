<p>I have been struggling a lot with my lolita purchases again. I get easily depressed when I miss out on things, but when I buy things I get a lot of anxiety from how much I spend and agonize on whether it was a really justified purchase. I decided to stop checking secondhand websites so much and try to spend more of my time and energy on creating things. I've been getting back to crocheting and have been working on a gingham blanket.</p>

<p>I think what has been fueling my purchases is Mary Magdalene's lack of activity. It greatly concerns me since in October last year they announced a comeback and they released a coat, but it's been crickets since then.</p>

<p>This coordinate is from awhile back. I went to go see hanami, but this is the best photo I could get with a toddler pestering my photographer. (I love my toddler, okay). It's super unusual for me to wear so much Innocent World, but I really like this dress.</p>
