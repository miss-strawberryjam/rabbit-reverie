<p>I went on a walk today at a nearby park. The bonnet I wore is new and it was sunny out so it was perfect for the occassion.
It was also the first time I put my hair in foam curls. I was taken aback by how much volume there is in my hair. 
I wanted to wear this coordinate with an apron and would have had I known it was going to be so hot (I was wearing a cardigan before, but thought a cardigan plus apron might not look great). I might edit this post later..
