<p>So for the longest time, my colors in lolita were primarily pastels. Pink being the main one.</p>

<p>I struggle a lot of coordinating darker colors. For example, I have no clue about black. I feel if you want all black coordinates, you need to start considering textures to make things more interesting. This is where I have absolutely have no idea.</p>

<p>For now, I'm trying out more earthy colors. Lately, I'm really into green and got Mary Magdalene's Elodie Doll. I figured I could match this with brown, burgundy, and navy. I liked that this dress can be coordinated with a kind of regimental feel, but also a natural/mori kind of aesthetic.</p>

<p>Cardigans are easy ways to bring in more colors. I'm waiting for these 2 modcloth cardigans to go on sale. Fingers crossed, it happens for Memorial Day weekend!</p>

<p>I also recently got these 2 blouses which will help with my earthy tone coordinates!</p>
