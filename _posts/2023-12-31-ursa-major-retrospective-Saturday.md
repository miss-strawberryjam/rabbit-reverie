<p>I'm so terrible at posting consistently. I also feel like I'm a terrible writer, but I'll try to stay positive and write more... (I wonder if I really mean that, heh :sweat:)</p>
Ursa Major is a lolita convention in the San Francisco Bay Area (where I live). 
<a href="https://apple-salad.tumblr.com/">apple salad</a>, <a href="https://petit-piaf.tumblr.com/">petit piaf</a>, and <a href="https://ordovicienne.tumblr.com/">ordovicienne</a> came to visit for this convention!

<p>On the second day of convention, apple salad and I organized a coordination of all colors (we organized it before hand) of Farutetto JSK by Mary Magdalene. I was able to find other girls from the local lolita community to wear the extra dresses. Both me and apple salad loaned dresses to other girls if they didn't own a dress. Typically classics are often underrepresented at these kinds of events so I was glad to make it happen.</p>

<p>And she was kind enough to loan me the mist color of Farutetto!!! T_T I felt so honored. It's not the easiest color to obtain since it was only released in China. 
Apple salad herself wore the navy color which is quite possibly the only piece of that color available since it was a sample.</p>

  <li>JSK, blouse: Mary Magdalene. Hair accessory too (which I guess I forgot to wear for this picture)</li>
  <li>Shoes - Taobao, they were hand painted to match the dress by apple salad. Her dedication to the project was crazy!</li>
</ul><br />

Apple salad also hand made pins for every participant of the Farutetto coordination.
petit piaf <i>additionally</i> hand made necklaces(!).<br />
They made a a pin/necklace for every participant for the color they wore. Since I wore mist, that was the color I received!<br />

<p>Although I live close by, we decided to book a hotel in the city. It was the right thing to do as we were really tired every day! This picture is from a display at the hotel.</p>
