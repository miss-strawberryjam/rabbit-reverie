    <p>It's really been over a year since I last posted! Wow! What was I doing :sweat:</p>
<p>I wanted to share some recent cute moments! It's really important to cherish everyday things! Because it's all the little things accumulated that really make up life! Big things can only happen every now and then. And happiness isn't a state to be achieved, it's a state that happens sometimes ^^</p>

<p>I met with my friend <a href="https://cloverbell.neocities.org/">Lune</a>! I felt really special that she took time out of her graduation trip to see me! <br />
Also, I've been looking to size down my wardrobe and I made a lucky pack for her ^^ She loved almost everything haha. It's wild how close our aesthetic matches ^^ Like not only do we both like classic, but we both like buntings, gingham, polka dots, etc. <br />
It's a little weird because I love classic lolita, but a part of me really loves cute stuff too... I want to match more cute things with my classic coords now. And include stuff I like like rabbits! ^^</p>

<p>This was from today~ It's comfort maxxxxxx to me. I was sitting at home in a well lit room water coloring and enjoying some barley tea! Not sure what it is about a simple life is being enjoyable. I love water coloring bun buns! Lune was a bad influence on me &gt;_&lt; She brings her watercolors everywhere... she showed me her sketchbook and I got inspired. I really wish I could be more creative! I like how the bottom "coffee" bun came out!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was quite rainy that day so we took all our pictures in doors! Luckily the house on the estate is beautiful too.</p>
<p>We quadripled wearing Mary Magdalene's <a href="https://lolibrary.org/items/mary-magdalene-valeria-jsk">Valeria</a>. It is one of my favorite lolita dresses so it was a dream that my friends own all colorways of the dress! I am wearing the forest colorway which was a dream dress of mine. It was only sold at Kera shop (in store and in person). I'm so happy to have obtained this dress!</p>
<p>There are many pictures/events of lolitas from East Asian countries wearing the same dress of different colors, but not many of these type of events happen in the West. So my friends really wanted to take the lead in making this happen!</p>
<p>I feel really grateful through the love of classic lolita and Mary Magdalene, I was able to make very close friends. I'm also very happy that we are able to do fun activities like this. I'm not sure if I'll post about it so I'll share it now, but I also visited apple salad tea in Montreal and we also did a trip to NYC for the Baby Stars Shine Bright fashion show.</p>
