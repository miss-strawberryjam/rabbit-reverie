    <p>There are times when I don’t step outside until evening. I get a peculiar feeling on those days - as if I’ve been holding my breath and only finally start to breathe when I leave home. The cool air that envelops the previously warm sidewalk and buildings calm me. It’s like the whole world is being reset for the next day. When I take my evening strolls, it strikes me how quiet the neighborhood becomes. There’s no singing birds, buzzing bees, cars, or children.. Just maybe some cicadas. I can take deep breaths and feel the cold air fill my body. I notice the lights in the houses start to dim and turn off. On my walks, I often see no one else. It’s curious to me that others start to close their eyes for the night when there is so much peace to enjoy outdoors. When I get home.. the calm leaves my body and this is when I start thinking about the long list of things I need to do, but I would like to remind myself to live in the moment and enjoy life as it is.</p>

    <p>So for the longest time, my colors in lolita were primarily pastels. Pink being the main one.</p>

<p>I struggle a lot of coordinating darker colors. For example, I have no clue about black. I feel if you want all black coordinates, you need to start considering textures to make things more interesting. This is where I have absolutely have no idea.</p>

<p>For now, I'm trying out more earthy colors. Lately, I'm really into green and got Mary Magdalene's Elodie Doll. I figured I could match this with brown, burgundy, and navy. I liked that this dress can be coordinated with a kind of regimental feel, but also a natural/mori kind of aesthetic.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/other pics/mm-elodie-doll-green.jpeg" class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block" /></p>

<p>Cardigans are easy ways to bring in more colors. I'm waiting for these 2 modcloth cardigans to go on sale. Fingers crossed, it happens for Memorial Day weekend!</p>
