    <p>The second part of the day was all about lolita. I got to meet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesaladtea/">applesaladtea</a> whom I twinned with! It felt like a dream come true to twin with someone as cool as her.</p>

<p>applesaladtea brought a phone tripod and we went to a park to take coordinate photos. I think they ended up really cute! Especially the back picture. This convinced me to get my own phone tripod. Maybe I'll actually take more coordinate pictures that won't be in front of a mirror.</p>

<p>We coordinated Mary Magdalene's Rose Basket JSK in mint. I feel really lucky to have this dress. It's one of my favorites and most worn pieces. Mint is also one of my favorite lolita colors. It's so hard to get Mary Magdalene these days due to second hand prices sky rocketing.</p>

<p>We then went to Fairmount Bagel. Montreal is famous for its bagels and it didn't disappoint. I'm not a bagel person, but they were deeee-licious!</p>
<p>applesaladtea made these yummy Madeleines :pleadingface: They were really good.. and it was just very sweet of her.</p>

<p>No picture, but we also went to a bar afterwards :)</p>

<p>It was a really satisfying meet up. Traveling always makes me so happy because I get to meet other lolitas! I think a lot of other lolitas do this too. They travel and reach out to the local community to see if anyone is available to meet. I felt especially welcomed by applesaladtea.. and it was amazing that she has the same taste in classic lolita as me. We hit it off really well and still keep in touch! :)</p>

Unrelated again: I'm so bored and need new friends.

<p>♪ Playing Weezer - Only in Dreams ♪ </p>
<p>There was a really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW7fNAKk6oc">Cowboy Bebop AMV</a> back in the day with Only in Dreams playing the background.</p>
<p>I've listened to this song for many years and I never get sick of it. I spent an hour listening to it earlier today while laying down and relaxing (yeah I'm one of those awful people that can listen to songs on repeat :sweat:)</p>

    <p>My company has an office in Montreal and I promised I would go to the next work party that occurred. Well, it happened on June 8th. So I booked my tickets to Montreal.</p>
<p>My goal of this trip -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visit a lot of cafes to draw</li>
  <li>Visit lolitas and twin as much as possible</li>
  <li>Visit the old buildings</li>
  <li>See my coworkers</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything was achieved :) </p>
<p>

<p>The start of the trip was a bit nerve wracking. I had received a text that my flight was canceled. (I already had a flight canceled earlier in the year so I felt quite unlucky.) The default option Air Canada gave me was a couple of days later which I wasn't happy with. In the end, I found an option that left 8 hours later. I had to panic pack, but it was worth it.</p>

<p>I had arrived around 8AM. The first stop was <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CYbnUnrpcPdsG41S9">Olive et Gourmando</a>, a cute place with good breakfast and lunch options. The Gruyere on my Cuban was quite good. I'm not a cheese connoisseur, but I could tell it was a lot better than the cheese we get in America :sweat:</p>

<p>I then proceeded to walk around Old Montreal where there are really beautiful, old buildings! They fit the lolita aesthetic soooo much. And it's interesting to see them in North America, not just in Europe. This is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kzaxA7AxKXuDN6rW6">Tommy Cafe</a>, it's super cute inside and outside.</p>

<p>It was a cafe I spent some time drawing at... this is how I far I got at Tommy Cafe. I'll show you the completed work for another Montreal post :)))) Also mind you, I'm just a beginner at drawing. By the way, I really like drawing because it helps me get in the zone! I can just start drawing and not have a care in the world.</p>

Unrelated to the Montreal trip.. I've been struggling a lot with my mental health. I have really low esteem and it seems to dictate my life and causes me to make poor decisions. I just wanted to thank my friends that put up with my shit.
