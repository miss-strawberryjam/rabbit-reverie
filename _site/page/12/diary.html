    <p>I have been struggling a lot with my lolita purchases again. I get easily depressed when I miss out on things, but when I buy things I get a lot of anxiety from how much I spend and agonize on whether it was a really justified purchase. I decided to stop checking secondhand websites so much and try to spend more of my time and energy on creating things. I've been getting back to crocheting and have been working on a gingham blanket.</p>

<p>I think what has been fueling my purchases is Mary Magdalene's lack of activity. It greatly concerns me since in October last year they announced a comeback and they released a coat, but it's been crickets since then.</p>

<p>This coordinate is from awhile back. I went to go see hanami, but this is the best photo I could get with a toddler pestering my photographer. (I love my toddler, okay). It's super unusual for me to wear so much Innocent World, but I really like this dress.</p>

    <p>So I actually went out today. It had been a very long time for me since I had afternoon tea (or even went out to eat). I felt such a sense of relief to have some normalcy. I didn't realize my local afternoon tea place was open on Friday's so I'm going to try to support them when I can.</p>

<p>I also obtained these shoes by Fluevog! They are called Caravaggio. I had eyeing them for a very, very long time. I also got them in burgundy which was my dream color. I was really happy with how it turned out with my outfit. I decided to look especially nice today since I wasn't sure when I could go out again.</p>

<p>The dress I was wearing was also a dream dress of mine and it is still one of my favorite pieces. I'm not sure what it is about Mary Magdalene and their florals, but I just swoon over them. Mint is also one of my favorite lolita colors. The cut of this dress also fits me very well so I have this dress in burgundy and lavender too. I don't think I'm the kind to own more than one colorway of a dress, but this one is an exception. The first colorway I got of this dress was burgundy. A girl in my local community was selling it and I met her over boba to make the purchase.</p>

<p>The jacket was also another highly coveted item for me. I really love the dusty pink color and also how it fits me very well. The details are subtle, but very pretty. I was lucky enough to have a friend sell this to me when she knew I wanted it badly. I haven't seen this sold secondhand once yet so I'm very thankful. Needless to say, this is a dream coordinate I'm so happy to wear.</p>

<p>p.s. I’m extremely triggered by how badly I tied my bow.. sorry. This is what happens when you’re in a rush so you don’t take too long of a lunch break.</p>
