    <p>Because it's a 3 day weekend, I miraculously had a little time to put together a coordinate. It's a really simple one, but I think this dress (Claudette by Mary Magdalene) is one of those dresses that thrives in the details and doesn't always need a lot of flair going on.

Too bad the lighting at my house is really terrible...

    <p>I went on a walk today at a nearby park. The bonnet I wore is new and it was sunny out so it was perfect for the occassion.
It was also the first time I put my hair in foam curls. I was taken aback by how much volume there is in my hair. 
I wanted to wear this coordinate with an apron and would have had I known it was going to be so hot (I was wearing a cardigan before, but thought a cardigan plus apron might not look great). I might edit this post later..
