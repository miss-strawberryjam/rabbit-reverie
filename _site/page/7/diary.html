    <p>I'm happy to report that I finished documenting my <a href="/wardrobe.html">wardrobe</a>!</p>

<p>So I've been a lolita for ~11 years now... I did not start off as a classic lolita! I wish I did, Mary Magdalene was really in their prime in 2013. I was a sweet classic lolita</p>
<p>So although I've been in the fashion for a very long time, I didn't start collecting Mary Magdalene until about 2016! I do feel lucky still, it was a lot easier to obtain pieces back then for a reasonable price. Now the demand is so high, but the supply is so low that the prices of Mary Magdalene pieces secondhand have sky rocketed.</p>

<p>So I cheated, a handful of the pictures from my wardrobe post are from 2018. I was too lazy to re-take the pictures ^_^;; My wardrobe was a lot smaller back then that I was able to finish taking pictures in a couple of hours. So it was easy to depend on natural light. I don't have that much time anymore and typically take pictures at night so I had to use some lights! Here's my set up. A friend of mine is very educated on these matters and helped me out. Otherwise I wouldn't have a clue! Initially I was using a dining room chair to take overhead pictures ^_^;; but it didn't seem very safe, so I bought a step ladder.</p>

	<th><img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_9222.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /><br />
	</th>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>I also recently started storing my Mary Magdalene pieces on a separate rack outside my closet (excludes some pieces). It brings me so much joy to see them. I worked hard to collect them and they're just so beautiful!

<p>Hmmmm so some highlights about me and my wardrobe!</p>
<li>My favorite color is probably mint. I would like to obtain more pieces! But I also clearly love pink. I'm surprised at the amount of dark pieces I have even though I don't feel I look good in them ^_^;;</li><br />
<li>My favorite dress at the moment is Griselda by Mary Magdalene. It's so simple, but has a really gorgeous collar! There's a lot of nice details, like the braid and gathered fabric. The only thing I wish was that this dress accommodated more petticoat! The black colorway of this dress kind of looks nun like. So I'm wondering if it was intentional to kind of emulate a nun look? (Talking out of my ass here)
<a href="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_9200.jpg"><img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_9200.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" /></a>
</li><br />
<li>My favorite motif now is gobelin! It's such a gorgeous fabric and totally embodies the aesthetic of classic lolita (looking like a grandma's couch). Even better that the below dress has velveteen too!
<a href="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_8806.jpg"><img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_8806.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" /></a>
</li><br />
<li>I'm more of a daily lolita (I don't wear it daily though lol) and prefer simple coordinates! Here's my favorite coordinate this year (which coincidentally is also Mary Magdalene's Chocolatier.)
<img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/1000009874.JPG" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" />
</li>
<li>This wardrobe post probably took upwards of 12 hours?! And I'm not quite happy with the result lol ^_^;; The mixed lighting in the photos bother me, but what can you do.</li>
<br />
<li><p>2023 was an amazing year in terms of lolita (not my personal life lol). I met many new friends. I traveled to Montreal for work and leisure and despite hardly knowing <a href="https://apple-salad.tumblr.com/">apple salad</a>, I twinned with her! After that, we became good friends. In addition, I also got to visit my dear friend <a href="https://petit-piaf.tumblr.com/">petit piaf</a> and we twinned Victorian Maiden's Rococo Bouquet.</p>

<p>Later the two also visited for the lolita convention, Ursa Major. And we did lots of tripling/quadrupling (<a href="https://ordovicienne.tumblr.com/">ordovicienne</a> included)! I have many photos from their visit, but I'll have to save it for another time.</p>
</li>
<li>I'm so thankful how lolita has helped me properly express myself. I am quite shy and don't have a way with words. But dressing in lolita makes me feel like I can be who I truly am. And I'm glad I have made so many friends while being my genuine self!</li>

    <p>Sneaky post, I don't think I will share this with my subscribers.. since it's not the most lolita related post.</p>
<p>I'm having a lot of mental health issues again unfortunately. I have extremely low self esteem and it really impacts my day to day life and how I interact with close ones. Just imagine going through every single day thinking you are ugly and worthless... It really impacts your energy levels and what you can do. I need constant reassurance that I'm not an awful person that deserves to be alone.</p>
<p>I am going through one of the hardest times of my life now. At least it feels like it. But when I zoom out and look at myself on paper, I should be so happy. Unfortunately I have had depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. The suffering gets to be too much on some days. I already consult mental health resources, but it's all so tiresome still.</p>
<p>Thanks to my friends for putting up with me. ;_;</p>
<p>I wil probably regret posting something so personal... but at the same time I wanted to share how difficult mental health issues can be ;_;</p>
