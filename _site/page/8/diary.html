    <p>I'm so terrible at posting consistently. I also feel like I'm a terrible writer, but I'll try to stay positive and write more... (I wonder if I really mean that, heh :sweat:)</p>
<p>Ursa Major is a lolita convention in the San Francisco Bay Area (where I live). 
<a href="https://apple-salad.tumblr.com/">apple salad</a>, <a href="https://petit-piaf.tumblr.com/">petit piaf</a>, and <a href="https://ordovicienne.tumblr.com/">ordovicienne</a> came to visit for this convention!</p>

<p>On the second day of convention, apple salad and I organized a coordination of all colors (we organized it before hand) of Farutetto JSK by Mary Magdalene. I was able to find other girls from the local lolita community to wear the extra dresses. Both me and apple salad loaned dresses to other girls if they didn't own a dress. Typically classics are often underrepresented at these kinds of events so I was glad to make it happen.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/ursa_major/1000012355.JPG" class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block" style="max-height: 100%; max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>And she was kind enough to loan me the mist color of Farutetto!!! T_T I felt so honored. It's not the easiest color to obtain since it was only released in China. 
Apple salad herself wore the navy color which is quite possibly the only piece of that color available since it was a sample.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/ursa_major/IMG_8529.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>JSK, blouse: Mary Magdalene. Hair accessory too (which I guess I forgot to wear for this picture)</li>
  <li>Shoes - Taobao, they were hand painted to match the dress by apple salad. Her dedication to the project was crazy!</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/ursa_major/IMG_9180.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /><br />
Apple salad also hand made pins for every participant of the Farutetto coordination.
petit piaf <i>additionally</i> hand made necklaces(!).<br />
They made a a pin/necklace for every participant for the color they wore. Since I wore mist, that was the color I received!<br /></p>

    <p>The second part of the day was all about lolita. I got to meet <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesaladtea/">applesaladtea</a> whom I twinned with! It felt like a dream come true to twin with someone as cool as her.</p>

<p>applesaladtea brought a phone tripod and we went to a park to take coordinate photos. I think they ended up really cute! Especially the back picture. This convinced me to get my own phone tripod. Maybe I'll actually take more coordinate pictures that won't be in front of a mirror.</p>

<p>We coordinated Mary Magdalene's Rose Basket JSK in mint. I feel really lucky to have this dress. It's one of my favorites and most worn pieces. Mint is also one of my favorite lolita colors. It's so hard to get Mary Magdalene these days due to second hand prices sky rocketing.</p>

<p>No picture, but we also went to a bar afterwards :)</p>

<p>It was a really satisfying meet up. Traveling always makes me so happy because I get to meet other lolitas! I think a lot of other lolitas do this too. They travel and reach out to the local community to see if anyone is available to meet. I felt especially welcomed by applesaladtea.. and it was amazing that she has the same taste in classic lolita as me. We hit it off really well and still keep in touch! :)</p>

<p>There was a really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW7fNAKk6oc">Cowboy Bebop AMV</a> back in the day with Only in Dreams playing the background.</p>
<p>I've listened to this song for many years and I never get sick of it. I spent an hour listening to it earlier today while laying down and relaxing (yeah I'm one of those awful people that can listen to songs on repeat :sweat:)</p>

<p>There was a really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW7fNAKk6oc">Cowboy Bebop AMV</a> back in the day with Only in Dreams playing the background.</p>
<p>I've listened to this song for many years and I never get sick of it. I spent an hour listening to it earlier today while laying down and relaxing (yeah I'm one of those awful people that can listen to songs on repeat :sweat:)</p>
