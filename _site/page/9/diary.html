    <p>Sorry for the blog neglect (again). My life has been a train wreck lately, sadly. But I've made a lot of progress on my independence since my last post! No trip to Montreal yet, but hopefully this year.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm obsessed with sweet lolita lately.</p>

I was really happy to have obtained this special tea party exclusive Day Dream Bed OP a couple of years ago.

<p>Random tidbit, but I discovered I'm not introverted, but extroverted with social anxiety.</p>

    <p>The last month or so of my life has all been about independence. I have a desire to be a stronger woman, to no longer depend on others.</p>

<p>I lived alone for a month. It was strange doing things on my own at first, but I came to enjoy the peace (and the daydreaming too!).</p>

<p>I am planning on going on a solo trip too! I was thinking of going to Montreal and Quebec City. I don't know much about it there, but in my mind, it seems like a perfect place for a classic lolita who likes old buildings and museums.</p>

<p>These small things may seem very trivial, I know.

One last thing.. I got this dress Panier de Fleurs! In the purple color! I have already worn it a couple of times and it has officially become one of my favorite dresses.
