I ordered this dress many months back. I have not been feeling passionate about lolita lately so when the dress arrived I let it sit in the box for awhile.. I had a look at it, but I did not try it on. I had imagined that it would not look good on me and that would be end of that.
</p>

<p>
But I finally decided on a whim to try it on and I am in love it. I wonder why I ever questioned my passion. Now I cannot wait to wear it until the next occasion.

    <p>Hello, like minded people that enjoy frills, it has been awhile since we last met.</p>
<p>I am upset at how little I can update my website, but I have also lost my passion for lolita (yet again).</p>
<p>A portion of it is related to how little time I have. I can count on my hands how many times I wore lolita in 2021. In a previous life, I used to yearn for the work week to end so that I could finally wear lolita over the weekend. Oh how times have changed..</p>
