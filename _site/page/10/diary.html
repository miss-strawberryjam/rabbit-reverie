    <p>The last month or so of my life has all been about independence. I have a desire to be a stronger woman, to no longer depend on others.</p>

<p>I lived alone for a month. It was strange doing things on my own at first, but I came to enjoy the peace (and the daydreaming too!).</p>

<p>I am planning on going on a solo trip too! I was thinking of going to Montreal and Quebec City. I don't know much about it there, but in my mind, it seems like a perfect place for a classic lolita who likes old buildings and museums.</p>

<p>These small things may seem very trivial, I know.

    <p>This will be a boring diary entry. It is boring because I said so. And you should probably stop reading now.</p>

<p>Life has been weird lately. There has been many unexpected things happening to me and I have been doing things that I thought I would never do.</p>

<p>Did I mention this entry would be very cryptic too?..</p>
<p>This is my outfit for perusing an antique fair in which I bought some photo frames.</p>

<p>I have been into headbands lately. And these glasses are new. Maybe I was going for a nerdy look? I am not sure.</p>
<p>I am only 10 years late, but I saw this movie recently "Dark Shadows". There is a character named Victoria Winters, the best way I can describe her aesthetic is vintage boarding school look. Unfortunately I looked up this term on Google and (surprise, surprise) found nothing like how she was dressed. But I love her aesthetic. Although my coordinate looks nothing like this.. I wanted to go for similar look, but not necessarily so drab and depressing. I am not sure if headbands and strange glasses fit this aesthetic, but it's OK to make stuff up along the way.</p>

<p><img src="assets/other_pics/victoria-winters.jpeg" class="img-rounded img-responsive center-block" style="max-height: 35%; max-width: 35%;" /></p>
<p>Hopefully I have not terribly bored you all.</p>
<p>(This is how I should sign all of diary entries.)</p>
<p>P.S. look ma, that person has a blue mustache!</p>
