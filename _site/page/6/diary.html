    <p>Today I went to meet other Mary Magdalene fans! I met with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokkigo/">Tokkigo</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beutalbaer/">beutalbaer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9340.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>I twinned with tokkigo, but didn't wear Mary Magdalene :sweat: But we wore one of my favorite Innocent World dresses, Anniversary Rose! I actually felt uncomfortable wearing so little Mary Magdalene hahahaha. Somehow it feels like I'm betraying my favorite brand ._.</p>
<p>This coordinate is a good representation of early 2010's when classic lolita was more popular. It feels weird wearing this classic... I don't feel like I suit bold colors and I also feel like it doesn't match my personality? Like it feels like it is for refined, confident women. Which is the opposite of what I am ^_____^;;</p>
<p>JSK, Blouse, Socks: Innocent World<br />
Rosette: Mary Magdalene<br />
Shoes: Fluevog<br />
Purse: vintage<br />

<p>It's tokkigo's birthday soon so I made her a rosette to match some of her dresses! I am a beginner with crafts so please be patient with me.. I remember when I first started lolita, handmade was much more encouraged. It was a lot harder to obtain brand items back then. After I made this rosette, I decided to put in another order for lace and ribbon to make more!</p>

    <p>My resolutions this year were to 1) Be productive, 2) Be more positive and continue working on mental health!</p>
<p>Part of being productive is working on my lolita crafts more. I made a gift for another lolita, but since she has not received it yet, I will blog about it another time!</p>
<p>Another part of being productive is wearing lolita more! I think there is a misunderstanding, I'm not a daily lolita. I'll wear it to random places like the grocery store, but only if I _have_ time. Lately, I do have some free time, so I have been wearing lolita! I also used to really dislike wearing lolita without make up, but I am trying to get over that feeling... because I dislike how it prevents me from wearing lolita. I am not wearing make up in any of the photos below! &gt;____&lt;;; I'll still wear make up to meets, with friends, etc. ^_^;;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9246.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Here is an outfit I wore the other night to get sushi with a friend. She had been in India for roughly a month. She is actually my coworker!</p>
<p>
OP, Hair rosette: Mary Magdalene<br />
Bag, Headdress: Victorian Maiden<br />
Shoes: Katie. I don't feel these shoes really match the ~classic lolita~ aesthetic, but I'm a sucker for 3 strap shoes.<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9286.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Here is a coordinate I wore to go shopping at Costco (if you know me, Costco is my ~happy place~). :sweat: See, I'm not a daily lolita, but I'll wear it when I have time!</p>
<p>
JSK, Hair rosette, Cardigan: Mary Magdalene<br />
Blouse: Innocent World. It's hard to see, but it's brown to match the tulle trim on the dress :)<br />
Shoes: Unpictured fint<br />
</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9287.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 65%; max-width: 65%;" /><br />
<img src="/assets/other_pics/IMG_9307.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Close up of my Arabesque coord. I bought the strawberry necklace from Gothic Lolita Market at Ursa Major. It's from a Japanese indie brand called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ameto.namida/">*ameto* Sweets Jewelry</a> I couldn't find any strawberries on their Instagram with flowers on it like mine. Maybe it's a sticker, hand painted, not sure. But it's a very lovely detail.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9291.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>One last picture. My friend asked me if Arabesque Rose is more ivory or white and I took this picture for her. Usakumya is white and the dress is ivory! I like the picture because it's very quintessentially lolita. The lighting makes it hard to see, but Arabesque Rose is ivory :)</p>
