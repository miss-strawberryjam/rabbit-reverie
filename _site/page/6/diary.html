<p>Mint is one of my favorite lolita colors! So I was really happy to receive Fleur de Lys in the mail. I will be selling my Delice Fleur to a friend! I also have a soft spot for gobelin. I know it's more technically old school... but classic lolita = old school? I mean it hasn't changed a lot in how it has looked over the years. At least the version of classic that I wear.</p>

<p>I have a small comment about the Wire Head dress. It's unlined, but literal couch fabric! So it's a little uncomfortable to wear. I have another gobelin dress by them which is a summer cotton (?) dress so unlined makes more sense.</p>

<p>Not much to report on this work day. I took my mom to the dentist and in striving in my goal to become more of a daily lolita, I wondered if I should wear lolita. I opted not to for such a quick errand. It did end up taking her 2 hours! I didn't realize people spend that long (on their first appointment with a new dentist). I had plenty of time to go to a cafe to work. Lolita dresses sadge to not be worn!</p>

    <p>Today I went to meet other Mary Magdalene fans! I met with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokkigo/">Tokkigo</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beutalbaer/">beutalbaer</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9340.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>I twinned with tokkigo, but didn't wear Mary Magdalene :sweat: But we wore one of my favorite Innocent World dresses, Anniversary Rose! I actually felt uncomfortable wearing so little Mary Magdalene hahahaha. Somehow it feels like I'm betraying my favorite brand ._.</p>
<p>This coordinate is a good representation of early 2010's when classic lolita was more popular. It feels weird wearing this classic... I don't feel like I suit bold colors and I also feel like it doesn't match my personality? Like it feels like it is for refined, confident women. Which is the opposite of what I am ^_____^;;</p>
<p>JSK, Blouse, Socks: Innocent World<br />
Rosette: Mary Magdalene<br />
Shoes: Fluevog<br />
Purse: vintage<br />

<p>It's tokkigo's birthday soon so I made her a rosette to match some of her dresses! I am a beginner with crafts so please be patient with me.. I remember when I first started lolita, handmade was much more encouraged. It was a lot harder to obtain brand items back then. After I made this rosette, I decided to put in another order for lace and ribbon to make more!</p>
