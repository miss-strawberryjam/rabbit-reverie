    <p>My resolutions this year were to 1) Be productive, 2) Be more positive and continue working on mental health!</p>
<p>Part of being productive is working on my lolita crafts more. I made a gift for another lolita, but since she has not received it yet, I will blog about it another time!</p>
<p>Another part of being productive is wearing lolita more! I think there is a misunderstanding, I'm not a daily lolita. I'll wear it to random places like the grocery store, but only if I _have_ time. Lately, I do have some free time, so I have been wearing lolita! I also used to really dislike wearing lolita without make up, but I am trying to get over that feeling... because I dislike how it prevents me from wearing lolita. I am not wearing make up in any of the photos below! &gt;____&lt;;; I'll still wear make up to meets, with friends, etc. ^_^;;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9246.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Here is an outfit I wore the other night to get sushi with a friend. She had been in India for roughly a month. She is actually my coworker!</p>
<p>
OP, Hair rosette: Mary Magdalene<br />
Bag, Headdress: Victorian Maiden<br />
Shoes: Katie. I don't feel these shoes really match the ~classic lolita~ aesthetic, but I'm a sucker for 3 strap shoes.<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9286.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Here is a coordinate I wore to go shopping at Costco (if you know me, Costco is my ~happy place~). :sweat: See, I'm not a daily lolita, but I'll wear it when I have time!</p>
<p>
JSK, Hair rosette, Cardigan: Mary Magdalene<br />
Blouse: Innocent World. It's hard to see, but it's brown to match the tulle trim on the dress :)<br />
Shoes: Unpictured fint<br />
</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9287.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 65%; max-width: 65%;" /><br />
<img src="/assets/other_pics/IMG_9307.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Close up of my Arabesque coord. I bought the strawberry necklace from Gothic Lolita Market at Ursa Major. It's from a Japanese indie brand called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ameto.namida/">*ameto* Sweets Jewelry</a> I couldn't find any strawberries on their Instagram with flowers on it like mine. Maybe it's a sticker, hand painted, not sure. But it's a very lovely detail.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9291.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>One last picture. My friend asked me if Arabesque Rose is more ivory or white and I took this picture for her. Usakumya is white and the dress is ivory! I like the picture because it's very quintessentially lolita. The lighting makes it hard to see, but Arabesque Rose is ivory :)</p>

  <h3><a href="/2024/01/02/2023-wardrobe-and-year-in-review.html">2023 Wardrobe And Year In Review</a></h3>
  <span class="date">2024-01-02</span>
  <div class="content">
  	<p>
    <p>I'm happy to report that I finished documenting my <a href="/wardrobe.html">wardrobe</a>!</p>

<p>So I've been a lolita for ~11 years now... I did not start off as a classic lolita! I wish I did, Mary Magdalene was really in their prime in 2013. I was a sweet classic lolita</p>
<p>So although I've been in the fashion for a very long time, I didn't start collecting Mary Magdalene until about 2016! I do feel lucky still, it was a lot easier to obtain pieces back then for a reasonable price. Now the demand is so high, but the supply is so low that the prices of Mary Magdalene pieces secondhand have sky rocketed.</p>

<p>So I cheated, a handful of the pictures from my wardrobe post are from 2018. I was too lazy to re-take the pictures ^_^;; My wardrobe was a lot smaller back then that I was able to finish taking pictures in a couple of hours. So it was easy to depend on natural light. I don't have that much time anymore and typically take pictures at night so I had to use some lights! Here's my set up. A friend of mine is very educated on these matters and helped me out. Otherwise I wouldn't have a clue! Initially I was using a dining room chair to take overhead pictures ^_^;; but it didn't seem very safe, so I bought a step ladder.</p>

	</th>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>I also recently started storing my Mary Magdalene pieces on a separate rack outside my closet (excludes some pieces). It brings me so much joy to see them. I worked hard to collect them and they're just so beautiful!

	</tr>
</table>

<p>Hmmmm so some highlights about me and my wardrobe!</p>
<li>My favorite color is probably mint. I would like to obtain more pieces! But I also clearly love pink. I'm surprised at the amount of dark pieces I have even though I don't feel I look good in them ^_^;;</li><br />
<li>My favorite dress at the moment is Griselda by Mary Magdalene. It's so simple, but has a really gorgeous collar! There's a lot of nice details, like the braid and gathered fabric. The only thing I wish was that this dress accommodated more petticoat! The black colorway of this dress kind of looks nun like. So I'm wondering if it was intentional to kind of emulate a nun look? (Talking out of my ass here)
<a href="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_9200.jpg"><img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_9200.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" /></a>
</li><br />
<li>My favorite motif now is gobelin! It's such a gorgeous fabric and totally embodies the aesthetic of classic lolita (looking like a grandma's couch). Even better that the below dress has velveteen too!
<a href="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_8806.jpg"><img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/IMG_8806.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" /></a>
</li><br />
<li>I'm more of a daily lolita (I don't wear it daily though lol) and prefer simple coordinates! Here's my favorite coordinate this year (which coincidentally is also Mary Magdalene's Chocolatier.)
<img src="/assets/wardrobe_post_2023/1000009874.JPG" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 50%; max-width: 50%;" />
</li>
<li>This wardrobe post probably took upwards of 12 hours?! And I'm not quite happy with the result lol ^_^;; The mixed lighting in the photos bother me, but what can you do.</li>
<br />
<li><p>2023 was an amazing year in terms of lolita (not my personal life lol). I met many new friends. I traveled to Montreal for work and leisure and despite hardly knowing <a href="https://apple-salad.tumblr.com/">apple salad</a>, I twinned with her! After that, we became good friends. In addition, I also got to visit my dear friend <a href="https://petit-piaf.tumblr.com/">petit piaf</a> and we twinned Victorian Maiden's Rococo Bouquet.</p>

<p>Later the two also visited for the lolita convention, Ursa Major. And we did lots of tripling/quadrupling (<a href="https://ordovicienne.tumblr.com/">ordovicienne</a> included)! I have many photos from their visit, but I'll have to save it for another time.</p>
</li>
<li>I'm so thankful how lolita has helped me properly express myself. I am quite shy and don't have a way with words. But dressing in lolita makes me feel like I can be who I truly am. And I'm glad I have made so many friends while being my genuine self!</li>
