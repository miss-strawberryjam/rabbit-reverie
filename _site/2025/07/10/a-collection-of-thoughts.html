          <h3>A Collection Of Thoughts</h3>
<p>10 Jul 2025 - strawberryjam</p>

<p>Hello! A certain individual has urged me to update my diary more often.. but I was given an array of prompts which made it even harder for me haha (-‚Äø-") I really like this individual so I will listen ehehehe (,,&gt;Ôπè&lt;,,)</p>
<p>I don't feel like I have much to talk about today.. so I'll just share a couple of pictures!</p>
<p>Oh and I do have a website update! I changed the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> so you can add comments without my involvement (I used to have to manually update the website.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only know how to add the name field, I wish you guys could also add your own websites especially if you come from Neocities. Feel free to leave it in the comment (but I'm not sure if the URL itself is allowed).</p>

<p>Over the 4th of July weekend, I hung out with some friends! Scarlett and I went to Gilroy to pick up a friend ^^ At the time, I was feeling really bored and jealous of everyone spending time with their families enjoying a BBQ. Scarlett and I were feeling lonely~  I should have spent some time reframing and being grateful for what I have perhaps.</p>
<p>I'm kind of at a cross roads in my life.. there's been so many changes. Hopefully for the better. But I've certainly closed some doors and started a new chapter. Sorry to be speak so vaguely.</p>
<p>I'm really thankful Scarlett moved back to the Bay Area - now I can spend a lot of time with her. She is a really close friend of mine, she reminds me a lot of myself when I was younger.</p>
<p>When I was at one of my lowest points in my life, she was there for me. She made sure I took care of myself. And if it weren't for her, I am not sure where I would be today. I'm very thankful I got to spend a lot of the weekend with her.</p>

	<p>I got a haircut! It's a hime cut (where there's hair to frame your face on the sides and it's cut quite blunt). I'm very happy with how it turned out!~</p>

	<p>I created this little booklet for myself.. since I am going through a lot of changes still. I wanted myself to point out how proud I should be. I'm not exactly sure how I'd like to articulate it yet, but I would like to try.</p>
