          <h3>Trying My Best In The New Year</h3>
<p>06 Jan 2024 - strawberryjam</p>

<p>My resolutions this year were to 1) Be productive, 2) Be more positive and continue working on mental health!</p>
<p>Part of being productive is working on my lolita crafts more. I made a gift for another lolita, but since she has not received it yet, I will blog about it another time!</p>
<p>Another part of being productive is wearing lolita more! I think there is a misunderstanding, I'm not a daily lolita. I'll wear it to random places like the grocery store, but only if I _have_ time. Lately, I do have some free time, so I have been wearing lolita! I also used to really dislike wearing lolita without make up, but I am trying to get over that feeling... because I dislike how it prevents me from wearing lolita. I am not wearing make up in any of the photos below! &gt;____&lt;;; I'll still wear make up to meets, with friends, etc. ^_^;;</p>

<p>Here is an outfit I wore the other night to get sushi with a friend. She had been in India for roughly a month. She is actually my coworker!</p>
<p>
OP, Hair rosette: Mary Magdalene<br />
Bag, Headdress: Victorian Maiden<br />
Shoes: Katie. I don't feel these shoes really match the ~classic lolita~ aesthetic, but I'm a sucker for 3 strap shoes.<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/coord/IMG_9286.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" style="max-height: 45%; max-width: 45%;" /></p>
<p>Here is a coordinate I wore to go shopping at Costco (if you know me, Costco is my ~happy place~). :sweat: See, I'm not a daily lolita, but I'll wear it when I have time!</p>
<p>
JSK, Hair rosette, Cardigan: Mary Magdalene<br />
Blouse: Innocent World. It's hard to see, but it's brown to match the tulle trim on the dress :)<br />
Shoes: Unpictured fint<br />
</p>

<p>Close up of my Arabesque coord. I bought the strawberry necklace from Gothic Lolita Market at Ursa Major. It's from a Japanese indie brand called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ameto.namida/">*ameto* Sweets Jewelry</a> I couldn't find any strawberries on their Instagram with flowers on it like mine. Maybe it's a sticker, hand painted, not sure. But it's a very lovely detail.</p>

<p>One last picture. My friend asked me if Arabesque Rose is more ivory or white and I took this picture for her. Usakumya is white and the dress is ivory! I like the picture because it's very quintessentially lolita. The lighting makes it hard to see, but Arabesque Rose is ivory :)</p>
